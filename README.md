Project proposal: I'm going to make a variant of Conway's Game of Life
for the Poincare Disc model of the hyperbolic plane. That is, the project
will render a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, and each tile will represent
a single cell. The rules of the game will probably just be that of life,
but may be changed depending on what has the best dynamic behavior.
Same goes for the tiling - So far the heptagonal tiling seems like it would
have the most 'life-like' behavior and would be the easiest for the user
to understand. An example of a similar interactive tiling can be found
[here](http://www.malinc.se/math/noneuclidean/poincaretilingen.php).

The basic functionality I want to implement is a static rendering of a single
tiling with a single rule. Once this has been finished, I will add other
nice features, such as being able to re-center the plane, or better colouring
rules for tiles, or letting the user choose the tiling and the game rules.
